Current FECH.AI action is not another PR lifecycle action. It is a bounded
**READ_ONLY J4/F1-02 gate reconstruction** against current live canonical evidence.

This Workspace snapshot intentionally preserves the full program trajectory instead of
collapsing continuity to the most recent PR.

## Current manual refresh override — 2026-09-01

This section supersedes the older FECH.AI snapshot below for current continuity only; historical delivery custody remains preserved.

## Status date

2026-08-29

## Canonical product repository

`wagnerjfjunior/sfjm-workspace`

Product-state precedence:

1. live `main`;
2. `handoffs/CURRENT.md`;
3. this file;
4. `docs/NEXT_SAFE_ACTION.md`;
5. other versioned Workspace documents.

External projects remain authoritative for their own product/security/runtime/program state.

## Canonical delivery state

Current canonical delivery anchor after the FECH.AI dashboard cycle:

```text
PR #21: MERGED
implementation head:
  6d3b80bf65777754802559ba4767a0f2298a2878
merge commit / main:
  0c8f03428ecd8f6b028f18bfaaefc98e20684f97
Vercel status on merge commit: SUCCESS
```

Relevant completed cycles include:

- FECH.AI external context and Continue representation;
- MoreNumTegra external manual context;
- PR #20 canonical Workspace bootstrap;
- PR #19 continuity reconciliation selecting FECH.AI Security-to-Scale tracking;
- PR #21 FECH.AI Security-to-Scale Roadmap + Runbook implementation.

## Implemented product state

The Workspace now includes:

1. approved Continue/Home continuity hierarchy;
2. Estado de Continuidade;
3. Próxima Ação Segura;
4. Contextos Preservados;
5. Visão da Jornada;
6. FECH.AI Macro Roadmap / Executive View;
7. FECH.AI M1 Operational Runbook View;
8. manual source/ref/date and invalidation provenance;
9. explicit Security Go and commercialization boundary labels.

The dashboard remains a manually refreshed visualization. It is not an automatic monitoring or synchronization system.

## FECH.AI snapshot represented

The current versioned dashboard carries a manual snapshot observed on 2026-08-28:

```text
repository: wagnerjfjunior/fecha.ai
observed main: 3eeb6fd230309f206be7920607739f8e4545556f
#141 Security-to-Scale 2026: OPEN
#142 M0: CLOSED / completed
#150 M1 Security Truth Baseline: OPEN / READ_ONLY FIRST
Security Go: NOT GRANTED
broad paid commercialization: BLOCKED
```

This is evidence-at-capture only. Resolve FECH.AI live before using those facts as current operational truth.

## Program progress representation

Progress is not inferred from PR count, activity, subjective health or elapsed time.

Dashboard rule:

```text
program progress = sum(milestone weight × accepted milestone completion)
```

Only accepted milestone-exit evidence represented by the versioned snapshot contributes.

The displayed percentage is a planning/accepted-gate visualization, not a Security Go, runtime-security or confidence score.

## Demonstrative/manual boundary

Not implemented or implied:

- backend/API integration;
- GitHub ingestion;
- webhook/cron/polling/background monitoring;
- automatic synchronization;
- write-back to FECH.AI or MoreNumTegra;
- automatic milestone advancement;
- Security Go automation;
- deployment/runtime monitoring.

## Current lifecycle state

The PR #21 delivery gate is closed and must not be reopened without material invalidation.

Current Workspace duty:

```text
VISUALIZATION / CONTINUITY
```

The next operational action belongs to the canonical external project whose work is being continued.

For FECH.AI, resolve its live canonical next action before execution. The carried snapshot points to M1-A READ_ONLY, but the Workspace does not independently establish that as current after any later FECH.AI change.

## Not authorized by this Workspace state alone

- deployment or Vercel configuration changes;
- backend/auth/database/Supabase implementation;
- automatic synchronization;
- external-project mutation/write-back;
- changes to `wagnerjfjunior/fecha.ai`;
- changes to `wagnerjfjunior/MoreNumTegra`;
- changes to `wagnerjfjunior/StopJuniorMode`.

## Rollback

If the Roadmap + Runbook implementation must be reverted, the bounded implementation unit is PR #21 / merge commit `0c8f03428ecd8f6b028f18bfaaefc98e20684f97`.
